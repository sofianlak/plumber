# Pipeline Bill of Materials (PBOM)

> ⚠️ **EARLY STAGE FEATURE** ⚠️
>
> PBOM is a **new feature being built from the ground up**. Unlike traditional SBOMs for application code, there is no existing recognized standard for documenting CI/CD pipeline dependencies. Plumber is leading in this space.

## Overview

A **PBOM (Pipeline Bill of Materials)** is an inventory of all dependencies used in a CI/CD pipeline: container images, GitLab CI components, templates, and includes. Think of it as an SBOM, but for your pipeline infrastructure instead of your application code.

Plumber generates PBOMs in two formats:

| Format | Flag | Best for |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Plumber PBOM** | `--pbom <file>` | Detailed pipeline-specific inventory with compliance metadata |
| **CycloneDX SBOM** | `--pbom-cyclonedx <file>` | Integration with Gitlab reporting, security tools (Grype, Trivy, Dependency-Track) |

```bash
# Generate both
plumber analyze --pbom pbom.json --pbom-cyclonedx pipeline-sbom.json
```

## Why CycloneDX (Not SPDX)?

| Aspect | CycloneDX | SPDX |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Primary focus** | Security & vulnerability tracking | License compliance & provenance |
| **Tool ecosystem** | Grype, Trivy, Dependency-Track | Good, but security tools prefer CycloneDX |
| **Component types** | Native `container` type fits our use case | Primarily software packages |
| **Format** | Clean JSON, easy to generate and parse | More complex, verbose |
| **Standardization** | OWASP project | ISO/IEC 5962:2021 |

CycloneDX was chosen because Plumber's primary use case is pipeline security, and the tools in the ecosystem (Gitlab, Grype, Trivy, Dependency-Track) have first-class CycloneDX support. SPDX export could be added as a future enhancement for license compliance use cases.

## Vulnerability Detection: What to Expect

🔬 **Important:** The PBOM will show **few to no vulnerabilities** in most scanners. This is expected and by design.

| Component Type | Example | Has CVEs in Public Databases? |
|----------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| Docker images | `golang:1.22`, `alpine:3.18` | Limited (image metadata only) |
| GitLab CI components | `gitlab.com/components/sast` | **No** |
| GitLab templates | `Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml` | **No** |
| Remote/local includes | Custom YAML files | **No** |

**Why?** GitLab CI templates and components are configuration files, not software packages. No vulnerability database (NVD, OSV, etc.) tracks CVEs for them. Docker image PURLs provide metadata-level lookups only, not the full vulnerability surface of the image contents.

**The PBOM's value today is inventory and visibility:**
- Know exactly what's in your pipeline
- Track versions and detect outdated components
- Compliance documentation (prove what tools your pipelines use)
- Drift detection over time (e.g., via Dependency-Track)

**For actual image vulnerability scanning**, scan the images directly:

```bash
trivy image golang:1.22
grype docker.io/library/golang:1.22
```

## Format 1: Plumber PBOM (`--pbom`)

The native Plumber PBOM format provides a detailed, pipeline-specific inventory with compliance metadata from the analysis.

### Structure

```json
{

## Format 2: CycloneDX SBOM (`--pbom-cyclonedx`)

The CycloneDX output follows the [CycloneDX 1.5 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.5/json/) for compatibility with standard security tools.

### Structure

```json
{
  "bomFormat": "CycloneDX",
  "specVersion": "1.5",
  "serialNumber": "urn:uuid:...",
  "version": 1,
  "metadata": { ... },

| `timestamp` | string | ISO 8601 generation timestamp |
| `tools[]` | array | Tool that generated the BOM (`plumber`) |
| `component` | object | The subject of the BOM (the project being analyzed) |

### `components[]` Array

Each component represents a pipeline dependency. Two categories:

#### Container Images → `type: "container"`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | string | `"container"` |
| `bom-ref` | string | Unique reference (e.g., `container:0`) |
| `name` | string | Image name |

**PURL format for Docker images:**

```
pkg:docker/namespace/name@tag
pkg:docker/namespace/name@tag?repository_url=registry
```

Examples:
- `pkg:docker/library/golang@1.22` (Docker Hub official)
- `pkg:docker/golangci/golangci-lint@latest` (Docker Hub user)
- `pkg:docker/security-products/sobelow@6?repository_url=registry.gitlab.com` (GitLab registry)

#### Includes → mapped types

| Include Type | CycloneDX Type | Description |

| `local` | `file` | Local file includes |
| `remote` | `file` | Remote URL includes |
| `project` | `file` | Cross-project file includes |

**PURL format for includes:**

```
pkg:gitlab/org/component@version          (components)
pkg:gitlab/project/path/file@version      (project includes)
pkg:generic/sanitized-location@version    (other types)
```

### Custom Properties (`plumber:*`)

CycloneDX components carry Plumber-specific metadata as properties:

| Property | Applies To | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| `plumber:registry` | containers | Container registry URL |
| `plumber:full-image` | containers | Full image reference |
| `plumber:jobs` | containers | Comma-separated list of jobs using this image |
| `plumber:authorized` | containers | `"true"` / `"false"` whether the image passes the authorized sources control |
| `plumber:forbidden-tag` | containers | `"true"` / `"false"` whether the image uses a forbidden tag |
| `plumber:include-type` | includes | Original include type (`component`, `template`, etc.) |
| `plumber:project` | includes | Source project for project includes |
| `plumber:latest-version` | includes | Latest available version |
| `plumber:up-to-date` | includes | `"true"` / `"false"` |
| `plumber:component-name` | includes | Component name |
| `plumber:from-catalog` | includes | `"true"` if from GitLab CI/CD Catalog |
| `plumber:nested` | includes | `"true"` if nested include |
| `plumber:gitlab-url` | metadata | GitLab instance URL |
| `plumber:project-id` | metadata | GitLab project ID |

---

## GitLab CI Integration

When using the Plumber component in GitLab CI, the CycloneDX output is automatically uploaded as a [GitLab CycloneDX report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/artifacts_reports/#artifactsreportscyclonedx). GitLab natively understands this format and will display the dependency list in the pipeline's **Licenses** tab (GitLab Ultimate) or as a downloadable artifact (all tiers).

```yaml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/getplumber/plumber/plumber@v0.1.26
```

Both `plumber-pbom.json` (native PBOM) and `plumber-cyclonedx-sbom.json` (CycloneDX) are generated and stored as pipeline artifacts by default.

---

## Tool Compatibility

The CycloneDX SBOM output has been tested with:

| Tool | Command | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| CycloneDX CLI | `cyclonedx validate --input-file sbom.json --input-format json` | Validates format correctness |
| Grype | `grype sbom:sbom.json` | Few/no vulns expected (see above) |
| Trivy | `trivy sbom sbom.json` | Few/no vulns expected (see above) |
| Dependency-Track | Upload via API or Web UI | Good for inventory tracking over time |

See [PBOM_TESTING.md](./PBOM_TESTING.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions for each tool.
